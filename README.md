# ProcessLog
Inspired by the app TodaysMeet, that closed down last week, for anonymous or not participation in meetings, I thought a realtime Process Log for project based and maker-centered classrooms could be very interesting. Something simple that as the process happens students jot down observations, comments, post questions, give feedback and post photos. The app could be a way for teachers in student centered environments to gauge what is going on and think about next steps for the individual paths of each student. It could also be a way for students to visualize their thinking and learning while also collaborating with their peers. After every session the content of the entry logs could be sent via email.
